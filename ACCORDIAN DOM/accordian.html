                <div class="question">Give your self introduction</div>
                 <div class="answer">Hello, my name is Gayatri, and Iam from Hyderabad. Iam currently in my final year of a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) degree and will be graduating this year. 
                    Ihave developed a strong interest in web development and have already learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals. 
                    Right now, Iam focusing on mastering the JavaScript DOM to create more interactive web pages. 
                    Iam passionate about learning new technologies and continuously improving my skills. 
                    Iam excited to start my career where I can apply and grow my technical knowledge."

                <div class="question">what are your strength</div>
                 <div class="answer">One of my key strengths is that Iam a quick learnerâ€”I can understand new concepts easily, especially when they are explained clearly. 
                    I also consider myself polite and calm in my communication. Ihave recently taken on a leadership role in my Barabri course, where Iam currently the team leader, 
                    and it has helped me improve my coordination and responsibility skills.
                     As for a weakness, I sometimes take extra time to complete a task because I want it to be perfect.
                     But Iam working on improving my time management while maintaining quality</div>

                 <div class="answer">In the next five years, I see myself in a leadership role, such as a team lead or a project coordinator. 
                    I want to grow within the company by continuously learning, taking on challenging tasks, and improving my technical and communication skills.
                    I believe that with consistent effort, a positive attitude, and a willingness to learn, I can contribute meaningfully and grow both professionally and personally

                     Iam dedicated, responsible, and always willing to improve. I also take feedback seriously and work hard to meet deadlines.
